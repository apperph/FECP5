## Overview

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) allows you to effectively manage access to AWS services and assets for your user base, ensuring a high level of security. This service is designed for organizations that have numerous users or systems utilizing AWS services like Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, and the AWS Management Console. IAM offers centralized user management, the administration of security credentials like access keys, and the regulation of permissions that determine users' access to AWS resources.

In this hands-on lab, you will gain knowledge on establishing IAM users.

### 1-d  
Enter a **user name**. This will be used to sign in to the AWS Management Console.  
![Step 1-d](https://sb-next-prod-image-bucket.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/public/GENC-Lab01/1-d.jpg)

### 1-e  
Set permissions by choosing **Attach policies directly**. IAM policies define what actions users, groups, and roles are allowed to perform.

### 1-f  
Search and attach the **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** policy.

## Enabling User's Access to Console

### 2-a  
Back in the IAM Users page, click on the newly created user.  
![Step 2-a](https://sb-next-prod-image-bucket.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/public/GENC-Lab01/2-a.jpg)

### 2-b  
Go to the **Security credentials** tab and click **Enable console access**.  
![Step 2-b](https://sb-next-prod-image-bucket.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/public/GENC-Lab01/2-b.jpg)

### 2-c  
Choose either an autogenerated or custom password. Optionally, require the user to change the password at the next sign-in.  
![Step 2-c](https://sb-next-prod-image-bucket.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/public/GENC-Lab01/2-c.jpg)

### 2-d  
Click **Apply** to enable the password. Optionally, download the `.csv` file with credentials.  
![Step 2-d](https://sb-next-prod-image-bucket.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/public/GENC-Lab01/2-d.jpg)

## Signing In as the IAM User

### 3-a  
Back on the Users page, copy the **console sign-in link**. Open a private/incognito browser tab, then log in using the IAM user credentials.  
![Step 3-a](https://sb-next-prod-image-bucket.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/public/GENC-Lab01/3-a.jpg)  
![Step 3-b](https://sb-next-prod-image-bucket.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/public/GENC-Lab01/3-b.jpg)

### 3-b  
After signing in, youâ€™ll see the username on the top-right corner, confirming IAM login.

### 3-c  
Navigate to **Amazon S3**.  
![Step 3-c](https://sb-next-prod-image-bucket.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/public/GENC-Lab01/3-c.jpg)  
![Step 3-d](https://sb-next-prod-image-bucket.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/public/GENC-Lab01/3-d.jpg)

### 3-d  
Attempt to delete a file inside the `genc-bucket-01` bucket.  
![Step 3-d2](https://sb-next-prod-image-bucket.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/public/GENC-Lab01/3-d2.jpg)

### 3-e  
You should receive a **permission denied** error since the IAM user only has read-only access.

## Final Step

### 3-f  
To complete the lab, submit your IAM username in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "user_name": ""
}
